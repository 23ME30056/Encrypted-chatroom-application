# Encrypted-chatroom-application
# RSA Algorithm Implementation in Chatbot 💬

Implementing the RSA encryption algorithm in a chatbot application for secure communication.

## Overview 🌐

This project demonstrates how to use the RSA algorithm to encrypt and decrypt messages exchanged between a server and a client in a chat application. RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) is a widely used asymmetric cryptographic algorithm known for its security in transmitting data over insecure networks.

## Features ✨

- **Encryption and Decryption:** Encrypt messages using the recipient's public key and decrypt using the private key.
- **Key Exchange:** Secure exchange of public keys between the server and client.
- **Multi-Threading:** Enable simultaneous sending and receiving of encrypted messages using Python's threading module.

## Requirements 📋

- Python 3.x
- `socket` module (for network communication)
- Basic understanding of RSA encryption principles
